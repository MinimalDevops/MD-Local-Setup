# MD Local Setup

This repository documents how to configure tools used for development and automation. Each setup step is provided via shell scripts so that it can be replicated easily.

## Requirements

The core requirement for all tooling is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). All other setup scripts expect `brew` to be available on your system.

### Installing Homebrew

Run the helper script from the `scripts` directory to install Homebrew. On macOS the script also installs the Xcode command line tools if they are missing and updates your `.zprofile` so `brew` is available in new shells. It will perform a check and skip installation if `brew` is already installed.

```bash
bash scripts/install_brew.sh
```

After Homebrew is installed you can add additional setup scripts for other tools in this repository. The repository now includes a helper to configure `zsh` with common plugins and utilities.

### Configuring zsh

Run the zsh setup script to install Oh My Zsh, useful plugins and command line utilities. Besides git, fzf, bat and direnv it also installs Warp, Ollama and Msty, configures the Powerlevel10k theme and adds handy aliases:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_zsh.sh
```

## Repository Structure

- `scripts/` â€“ collection of shell scripts used to install and configure tools. Includes helpers for installing Homebrew and configuring zsh.

Further instructions will be added as additional tools are incorporated.

## Additional Tools

### Grafana

Install and start Grafana using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install grafana
brew services start grafana
```

### DBeaver

```bash
brew install --cask dbeaver-community
```

### PostgreSQL

```bash
brew install postgresql@17
```

### Ngrok

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

After installing, obtain your auth token from Ngrok and configure it before use.

### n8n and Ngrok

Expose port `5678` with Ngrok and store the resulting HTTPS URL in an `.env` file under the `n8n` folder:

```env
WEBHOOK_URL=https://acd.ngrok-free.app
```

#### Local installation

Install n8n globally and start it so that it can access files on your machine:

```bash
npm install -g n8n
n8n start
```

#### Docker (optional)

Create a persistent volume and start the container interactively:

```bash
docker volume create n8n_data
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  -e WEBHOOK_URL=https://acd.ngrok-free.app \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

To run n8n in the background:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  -e WEBHOOK_URL=https://acd.ngrok-free.app \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```
